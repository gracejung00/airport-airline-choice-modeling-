# ✈️ Passenger Airport & Airline Choice Modeling

This project analyzes how passengers in the Seoul Metropolitan Area choose between two major airports—Incheon (ICN) and Gimpo (GMP)—and among various airlines. Using survey data from 488 respondents, we applied logistic regression and decision tree models to explore how demographics, travel behavior, and flight-related factors influence decision-making.
